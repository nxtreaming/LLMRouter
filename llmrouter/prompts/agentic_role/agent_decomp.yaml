  Given the query '{query}', decompose it into as many as 4 meaningful sub-queries (minimum 1, maximum 4). \
  Try to cover the full scope of the original query by breaking it down into multiple specific and distinct sub-tasks \
  whenever possible. Aim for the maximum number of high-quality sub-queries without introducing redundancy. \
  Each sub-query should be clear, self-contained, and semantically coherent. \

  **Output formatting rules (must be followed strictly):**
      - Output only the decomposed sub-queries, one per line.
      - Do not include any other text, explanations, or headers in your output.
      - Each line should contain only one sub-query.
